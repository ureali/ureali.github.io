            <p>My name is Stanislav, I'm 18 years old</p>
            <p>I've created this website mainly for an easy access to my school projects. 
                But I think having personal webpage in our age is a big flex, so why not also write about something interesting to me</p>
            <p>I've finished highschool in 2023, and now I'm studying at St. Clair</p>
            <p>I love monkeys, you're gonna see them a lot on this site</p>
            <p>If you wish to contact me, please do it either in person or through whatever channel got you to this website. I don't know how to hide my email from spammers yet lol.</p>
