            <h1>New Look for the Website!</h1>
            <p> I've played around with css a little, now my webpage looks fabulous! Really tasteful, love it! Especially the new font, really stylish. 
                It's Poppins if someone wonders, you can find it on Google Fonts (it has open license!)
            </p>

                Not even sure if I'll change this website much, looks gorgeous as it is. Although I definitely need to adapt it for phones.
                Like, the menu is too big and not centered at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also I'm planning changing the blog catalogue, at least by adding thumbnails, but for this I'll wait for college to teach css I guess.
                Don't want to learn eveything myself and then just waste time in the classroom lol.
